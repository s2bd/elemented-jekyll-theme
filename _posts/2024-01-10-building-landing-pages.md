Landing pages are crucial for converting visitors into customers. With Elemented's extensive component library, you can create professional, high-converting landing pages in minutes rather than hours.

## Essential Landing Page Components

### 1. Compelling Hero Section

Your hero section is the first thing visitors see. Make it count:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include hero.html 
   title="Transform Your Business Today"
   subtitle="Discover how our solution can increase your revenue by 300%"
   size="large"
   background_image="/assets/images/hero-bg.jpg"
   buttons=page.hero_buttons
%}{% endraw %}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep headlines under 10 words
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Use high-quality background images

### 2. Social Proof with Testimonials

Build trust immediately with customer testimonials:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include testimonials.html 
   title="Trusted by 10,000+ Businesses"
   testimonials=site.data.testimonials
%}{% endraw %}
```

### 3. Feature Benefits Grid

Highlight your key value propositions:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include features.html 
   title="Why Choose Our Solution"
   features=site.data.landing_features
%}{% endraw %}
```

### 4. Pricing That Converts

Make your pricing clear and compelling:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include pricing.html 
   title="Simple, Transparent Pricing"
   plans=site.data.pricing_plans
%}{% endraw %}
```

## Landing Page Structure

Here's a proven structure for high-converting landing pages:

1. **Hero Section** - Grab attention immediately
2. **Problem Statement** - Identify the pain point
3. **Solution Overview** - Present your solution
4. **Social Proof** - Build credibility
5. **Features/Benefits** - Explain value proposition
6. **Pricing** - Remove price objections
7. **FAQ** - Address common concerns
8. **Final CTA** - Drive action

## Optimization Tips

### Mobile-First Design
All Elemented components are mobile-responsive, but always test on actual devices:

- Keep forms short on mobile
- Use large, tappable buttons
- Optimize images for fast loading
- Test scroll behavior

### Performance Matters
- Optimize images (use WebP format)
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Enable compression
- Use a CDN for assets

### A/B Testing
Test different variations:
- Headlines and copy
- Button colors and text
- Image choices
- Form lengths

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much information** - Keep it focused
2. **Weak headlines** - Make them benefit-driven
3. **No social proof** - Always include testimonials
4. **Unclear CTAs** - Make actions obvious
5. **Slow loading** - Optimize for speed

## Example Landing Page Code

Here's a complete landing page structure:

```liquid

{% raw %}{% include hero.html %}

<section class="problem-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Tired of Manual Processes?</h2>
    <p>Most businesses waste 40% of their time on repetitive tasks...</p>
  </div>
</section>

{% include features.html 
   title="Automate Everything"
   features=site.data.automation_features
%}

{% include testimonials.html 
   testimonials=site.data.customer_testimonials
%}

{% include pricing.html 
   plans=site.data.saas_pricing
%}

{% include cta.html 
   title="Ready to 10x Your Productivity?"
   buttons=page.hero_buttons
%}{% endraw %}
```

## Measuring Success

Track these key metrics:
- **Conversion rate** - Visitors to customers
- **Bounce rate** - Single-page sessions
- **Time on page** - Engagement level
- **Scroll depth** - Content consumption
- **Form completion** - Lead generation

## Conclusion

With Elemented's component library, creating high-converting landing pages becomes a systematic process rather than starting from scratch each time. Focus on your message and value proposition while letting the components handle the design and functionality.
